Let's all sing
For the spring
It's the time when birds take wing
And the bees all buzz
But be carefull cause they sting
These are all the signs of spring

Let's all sing
For the spring
Go outside and ride a swing
Let your kite fly high
Just stand back untill the string
These are all the signs of spring

Let's all sing
For the spring
Butterflies on flowers cling
And the grass geows green
It is such a lovely thing
These are all the signs of spring

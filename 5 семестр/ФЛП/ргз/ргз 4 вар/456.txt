Let's all sed
For the spred
It's the time when birds take wed
And the bees all buzz
But be carefull cause they sted
These are all the signs of spred

Let's all sed
For the spred
Go outside and ride a swed
Let your kite fly high
Just stand back untill the stred
These are all the signs of spred

Let's all sed
For the spred
Butterflies on flowers cled
And the grass geows green
It is such a lovely thed
These are all the signs of spred
